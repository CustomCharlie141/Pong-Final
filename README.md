# Pong-Final

Here I added a simple piece of code in the main.lua file and it adds ai which the cs50 Game "Tracks" asked for. The goal was to make an AI implementation in the pong game and I have achieved that. The change of code is in the main.lua file on lines 206-213. The code basically is that the AIpaddle moves in the direction of the ball. So if the ball is at o which means the ball is going in a straight line, the paddle stays in a straight line( or  at index 0). the paddle goes up if the ball is going up and down if the ball is going down. This was a big challenge for me to do since I was having trouble figuring out the files and how I should implement the AI. Also LOVE(the app that I was using to run pong) is a little bit old and doesn't have the greatest wiki. I enjoyed this and it was a headache but fun challenge to do and I felt so satisfied when I got it working right. If you want to run this code. Download LOVE and the distribution code on the CS50 tracks, then you can copy my main.lua file to yours. Make sure you can drag the pong file into LOVE and also drag THE pong file and not the contents of the pong file, otherwise you will get an error. Have Fun and thank you for a wonderful year
